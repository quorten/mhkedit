MhkEdit
=======

MhkEdit is short for Mohawk Edit.  The purpose of this software is to
provide a nice user-friendly editor for the "Mohawk" archive files
used with the Mohawk game engine.  Back in the 1990s, the Mohawk game
engine was very popular with many Broderbund computer games.  The game
engine itself originated from the Myst and Riven games.  This
particular software is designed to target game engine implementation
used in "Orly's Draw-a-Story."  In principle, Mohawk archive files are
quite similar to Doom WAD files, and in some ways the two game engines
were nearly direct competitors.

Currently, this particular software is still in a highly incomplete
in-development phase and doesn't really do anything useful other than
provide an example native Windows GUI.
